# Linux Command Cheat Sheet

## Linux Command Structures

A command is a program that tells the system to do something. It has a structure like following
`command [options] [arguments]`

- Command works on  particular arguments. `arguments` are like extra pieces of information to perform the command. Here `arguments` are like  function arguments that tells command  what to perform
- On the other hand `options` are used to control the command behavior.
    - `options` are generally letter  preceded by hyphen(-). e.g. `ls -a`   or word preceded by a double hyphen(â€”). e.g. `ls --help`
    - More than one options can be used with a command in two form. separate form and lumped form
    - Separate form is like `command -[option] -[option] - [option]`. e.g. `ls -a -l -t`
    - For most commands more than one options can be lumped together in to form `command -[option][option]`. e.g.  `ls -alt` . One thing to remember that not all commands supports lumped options but most command  support.

## Linux File System

Computer organizes files in  tree like structure that is know as file system. Linux has a single file tree system that begins with root directory(/). In Linux almost everything is a file including USB Device, Hard disk etc. 

- File name are not case sensitive
- file begin with `.` used for configuration file

## Basic Commands

- `cd` - To change directory
- `mkdir` - make/create directory
- `pwd` - Print Current directory
- `ls` - List Directory Content
- `cp` -  copy files and directory
- `mv` - Move or rename file
- `rm` - remove directory and files
- `rmdir` - Use to remove only empty directory. It does not delete directory that is not empty.
- `cat` - Concatenate and display whole file
- `exit` to exit the terminal from command line
- `clear` clear terminal

## Common Linux Flags

- `-h`
- `-v`
- `-r`

## Directory and Navigation

There are two ways to denote a path. relative path and absolute path. Relative path references relative to current directory. On the other hand absolute path start at the root(/) directory and we can reference it from anywhere in the file system.

- Shortcut notation to directory
    - `/`   root directory
    - `.`   Current directory
    - `..` Parent directory
    - `~`   Home directory
    - `-`   Previous directory
- `pwd` Print the Current Working Directory
- `cd /` Go to root directory
- `cd ..` Go to parent directory
- `cd ~` Go to Home directory
- `cd -`Go to previous directory
- `cd /dir1/dir2`  Navigate to a particular directory

## Folder & File Create

- `mkdir dir1` Create directory named dir1  inside current working directory
- `mkdir -p /dir1/testDir`  Create a directory inside dir1. If dir1 does not exist the -p flag indicates that create parent directory `dir1` if needed.
- `touch shuvangkar.txt` Create a text file inside current directory named shuvangkar.txt
- `touch /dir1/testfile` Create `testfile`  file inside dir1

## File and Directory Listing

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 	pi 	pi 	4096 	May 25 20:47 Desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 	pi 	pi 	5781 	Feb  3 07:07 ocr_pi.png
drwxrwxr-x 2 	pi 	pi 	4096 	Mar 10 12:20 python_games
--------     -------  -------  -------- ------------ -------------
   |             |        |         |         |             |
   |             |        |         |         |         File Name
   |             |        |         |         |
   |             |        |         |         +---  Modification Time
   |             |        |         |
   |             |        |         +-------------   Size (in bytes)
   |             |        |
   |             |        +-----------------------        Group
   |             |
   |             +--------------------------------        Owner
   |
   +----------------------------------------------   File Permissions
```

- `ls` command options
    - -l = long listing
    - -a= list hiddent files
    - -r = list in reverse name
    - -t = list new files first
    - rt = list in reverse time(oldest first)
- `ls  -l /tmp/dir1/` show to long listing of all files inside `/tmp/dir1/`

## Copy Files & Directories

- `cp [option] [source] [destination]` Common format for `cp` command.
- To perform copy operation, the source must have read permission and destination must have write permission. Otherwise permission denied error is shown.
- The source can be single or multiple files or directories . destination have to be single file or directory
- `cp file1 backfile1` copy `file1` content to `backupfile`
- `cp file1.txt file2.txt dir1` copy `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to the directory `dir1`. When copying multiple files the destination must be a directory.
- `cp -r -v  /tmp/sourcedir desDir/` copy `sourcedir` into `destDir`. `-r` flag indicate recursively means copy whole directory contents. `-v` indicate show verbose output while copying

## Move & Rename

Move command(mv) has two functions. By default Linux does not have rename option. So it rename file and folder. It default function is to move files and folder

- `mv [options] [source]  [destination]` Default syntax
- `mv file1.txt diffname.txt` rename `file1.txt` to `diffname.txt`
- `mv file1.txt file2.txt dir1` move both of the files in folder dir1
- `mv /tmp/testfile .` Move `testfile` to the current directory
- `mv *.txt dir2` move all text file to dir2 folder

## Delete Files & Directory

- `rm /dir1/testfile` remove `testfile` from `dir1` folder
- `rmdir /tmp/testdir` remove `testdir` if it is empty
- `rm -r /tmp/testdir` recursively delete `testdir` folder
- `rm -rf /tmp/testdir` -f flag indicate force delete. -r indicate recursively

## Ubuntu Software Install and Uninstall

In Linux world software is the package. different Linux distribution has different package management tool. RedHat has yum, Debian has apt. apt(Advanced Packaging Tool) is the default package management tool for Ubuntu 

- `sudo apt update` update the local package list with latest change made in the repositories
- `sudo apt upgrade` First update package index using update command and then this command upgrade all package
- `sudo apt install <package_name>` Install a particular package from package_name
- `sudo apt install -y git` The option -y tells the apt to assume the answer to all prompts is yes
- `sudo apt remove  <package_name>` remove package but leave configs
- `sudo apt purge <package_name>` remove package and configs. It may not be the desired effect. So use with caution
- `apt search filezilla` search `filezilla` package
- `apt autoremove` remove the unnecessary package file

Note : While apt is a command-line tool, it is intended to be used interactively, and not to be called from non-interactive scripts. The apt-get command should be used in scripts (perhaps with the --quiet flag). For basic commands the syntax of the two tools is identical.

## How To Get Help

- `man -k gzip` finds gzip related manual
- `gzip --help`   print quick list of manual
- `man gzip` Manual open

## Linux Networking

- `ip -j -p addr show` To list network details in JSON format

## Generate SSH Key and Copy on the clipboard

1. /dev/zero is a special file that provides an endless stream of null characters that is used to create file or memory pages. 

```bash
sudo apt install xclip -y #xclip will copy the ssh file
cat /dev/zero | ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "keyname" -q -N "passphrase"
xclip -sel clip <~/.ssh/id_25519.pub

```
